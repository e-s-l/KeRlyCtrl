# The First Attempt

## ABOUT

The *TCP server version* sketches the required functionality. It does for all
intents & purposes *work* but would be a pain to employee.

The *first version* under the `Mqtt` directory also technically works. However, it was
my first undertaking in this area & has some designs that should be optimised.
It was put together over a longweekend at home, hence the name.

The final version is in the sibiling directory `second_version`.

## FIXME

- Addresses in the configuration file need to refer to domain names NOT hardcode ip
  addresses.

- Use the more robust (& complex) mqtt client.
