# about

this verison is/will be a slight improvement on the *first_attempt*. 

and despite, that it seems, now this project has stalled, will be the
*deployment* version.

## upgrades/to do

use this implementation of a mqtt client: https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-mqtt

minimise memory usage *ie* have a debug version of the program which prints
`mem_info` liberally.
